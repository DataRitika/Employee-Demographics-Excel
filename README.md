# Employee-Demographics-Excel
This project focuses on building an Employee Demographics Dashboard using Microsoft Excel. It visualizes key HR metrics such as total workforce size, average salary, bonus percentage, tenure, gender and age distribution, headcount by country, and hiring trends. Interactive slicers allow dynamic filtering by gender, department, job role, business unit, and activity status, enabling users to explore workforce patterns and make data-driven decisions effectively.
